<h1 style="text-align:center; color:white;">Welcome to my Website!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-size:15px;">This is a website created using HTML (HyperText MarkUp Language). I will teach you how you will be able to create a website using HTML code. You will learn how to have content including words, links, pictures, and videos on your webiste. You will even get to learn how to make your website avalible to the public. I hope you will be able to easily learn and enjoy this webiste.</p>
<p style="color:black; font-size:18px;">1.  First, we will learn how to obtain a document to make this. If you are on a Chromebook or any other type of computer that has a Chrome Web Store, then seach up the (If you click on the link, click the back arrow to come back to this website) <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SdKdh9RQeR6layWVWaVgMqCPs8j0HNeyiSrXzObHVciGHXYTj2fZkZoYMb13R0jq5vATFuKj6HOV0NahuXoAmnczJQ=s128-rj-sc0x00ffffff"> Caret</a> app and add it to Chrome. If you are on a regular laptop/computer (Dell, HP, etc.), then search for the app <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Notepad_Win11.svg/1200px-Notepad_Win11.svg.png">Notepad</a> on the app below. Then, go to your files and make a HTML folder (make a new folder which can happen by clicking 3 dots and new folder or plus sign and folder. You can name it whatever you want). Then, go back to the notepad, and click on File, then Save As. Save the file into your HTML folder (by clicking on the folder), and name the file what you want, but the name must end in ".html" (Do not type the quotation marks). Now, you are ready for putting in the code.</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">2. We will now put in the code. If there are blanks, it means that you need to put in text of your choice. Do not type what is in the pharentheses (). If you make a small mistake in the code, the layout of your web-page may be affected, so if you see that your web-page is affected, refer back to the picture for help. Here is the code that you need to put in:</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">If you need to put more regular text, then use the same code that is at the very end of the image above. Just use the words that you want to use instead of the blank.
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">3. We will now learn how to insert a video using HTML code. The video must be in your files, and to have it on your website, you must put it in  your HTML folder. You can do this by copying and pasting the file into your folder. Here is an example of how your video will end up on your website:
</p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="b.webm"type="video/webm">
</video>
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">This is the code to insert a video. On the first blank shown on the image, put the exact name of the video file. you can either copy and paste the name of the file onto the notepad, or you can make it have a simple name that you will be able to easily type. On the second blank, note what your video ends in. It can end in .mp4, .webm, and more. Whatever type of file it is, note it on the second blank (but do not put the blank. For example, if your video is a mp4, it the code yould be type="video/mp4").

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">4. We will now learn how to make a link appear as something else. You can use the following code to insert the link on your website.</p>
<img src="d.png">
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">5. The last content-wise thing we will learn to insert on our website is a picture. Make sure you have downloaded the image. On the blank, insert the exact name of the file. In review, ways you can do this are by copying and pasting just the name of the file onto the notepad, or by keeping a simple name for the file so that you will easily be able to type it on the notepad. Insert the following code:</p>

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">6. Once you have completed your website, you are ready to make it official! To make it an official website, you need a web hositing service. This website's web hosting service is <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, and I will show you how to use it. You first need to create an account, and in that accout, create a username. Note that this username will be part of your final url. On the top right corner, you should see a plus sign. Click on it, and then click 'New Resporitory.' Then, in the field that asks for the repository name, insert what you want the name of the resporitory to be. This will be part of the final url. This is what the final url will look like: username.github.io/respository-name. After that, scroll down and click 'Click Resporitory.' Then, you need to upload your HTML file to the resporitory. Find the light blue box that says 'Quick Setup.' Underneath this, there should be a button that lets you upload an existing file. When it takes you to the next screen, click the blue button that kets you choose a file. After you do, scroll down and click 'Commit Changes.' After you have finished that, look towards the top of the page. There should be a settings button. Click on it. There is a menu on the left. The last option in the section 'Codes and automation' is a button called 'Pages.' Click on it. You should see a bolded word 'Branch' somewhere on the page after you click Pages. Underneath it, there should be a drop-down menu leading button that currently says 'None.' Click on it, and click the option 'main.' After that, click 'Save.' After a few minutes, at the top of your page, it will let you know that your website is live, and it will give you the url. If it shows as an error, you may have to repeat the website-creating process a couple of times.</p>
